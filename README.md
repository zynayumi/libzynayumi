## FAQ

### Are these clicks and glitches normal?

It's easy to generate undesired clicks, especially in the attack and
release.  This may not be a bug of Zynayumi though.  To avoid such
clicks set a non null attack time and release of the amplitude
envelope.  See *Env attack time* and *Env release* parameters.

Also, the amplitude envelope itself can create clicks as it is driving
the emulated YM2149 to control the amplitude in a staircase fashion.
This is a feature, not a bug.

### Wait, that tuning is too perfect to come from the YM2149!?

Yes, I've modified ayumi so that tuning is perfect.  To enable legacy
tuning instead use the *Tone legacy tuning* parameter.  Using legacy
tuning produces more glitches when combined with the ring modulator.
This is a feature, not a bug.

### Why does the buzzer disable the envelop?

Because the buzzer was originally designed to be an envelop, even
though it is typically used as an oscillator, as is the case here.  To
avoid disabling the envelop you may use the ring modulator instead.

### Why can't I hear any difference between the YM2149 and AY-3-8910?

The difference is subtle and has to do with

1. The mapping of the 16 possible volume levels to their corresponding
   dBs.

2. The frequency of the clock, 2MHz for the YM2149 (Atari ST) and 1MHz
   for AY-3-8910 (Amdstrad CPC).  This affects the noise period and
   the legacy tuning.

3. The envelop (buzzer) of the YM2149 (Atari ST) offers 32 possible
   volume levels instead of 16 for the AY-3-8910 (Amdstrad CPC).

The YM2149 (Atari ST) was mono while the AY-3-8910 (Amstrad CPC) was
stereo, but here stereo is supported in both modes.  One can always
disable stereo with the *Pan0* to *Pan2* parameters.

### Why do I hear a ringing in my ears?

Be careful, chip sounds tend to be rich in harmonics, if you expose
yourself for too long at high volume you risk to loose your hearing
permanently.

Take plenty of sonic rest.  Use low pass filters, earplugs, work at
low volume, take any means necessary to reduce your exposure to
harmful sounds and protect your hearing.
